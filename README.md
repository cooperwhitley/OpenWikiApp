# Open Wiki

An open source standard for custom wikis. Fans can set up a wiki for something they're excited about by simply cloning and deploying this repo, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/cooperwhitley/OpenWikiAPI">associated API</a>. No longer will using ad-riddled low performance proprietary wiki web apps or designing your own be the requirement to build a knowledge base for an online community.
